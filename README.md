# orthofinder_tests
bash and slurm scripts for initial tests on Orthofinder tool

I used conda to install Orthofinder in my HPCC home, which required creating a new environment. The slurm scripts then activate this environment before running the orthofinder command.
The initial slurm scripts do the vanilla Orthofinder analysis without gene trees.
